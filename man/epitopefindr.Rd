\title{epitopefindr: a package for identifying minimal overlaps from BLAST alignments.}
\description{
The purpose of this package is to describe the alignments among a set of
peptide sequences by reporting the overlaps of each peptide's alignments to
other peptides in the set. One can imagine inputting a list of peptides
enriched by immunoprecipitation to identify corresponding epitopes.
}
\details{
`epitopefindr` takes a .fasta file listing peptide sequences of interest and
calls BLASTp from within R to identify alignments among these peptides. Each
peptide's alignments to other peptides are then simplified to the minimal
number of "non overlapping" intervals* of the index peptide that represent all
alignments to other peptides reported by BLAST. *By default, each interval
must be at least 7 amino acids long, and two intervals are considered NOT
overlapping if they share 6 or fewer amino acids. After the minimal overlaps
are identified for each peptide, these overlaps are gathered into aligning
groups based on the initial BLAST. For each group, a multiple sequence
alignment logo, or motif, is generated to represent the collective sequence.
Additionally, a spreadsheet is written to list the final trimmed amino acid
sequences and some metadata.
