# epitopefindr 1.1.31 (2024-04-24)
- working on version compatibility R packages from 2024


## Major Changes  
- Added parameter `peptide.once.per.group` to `indexGroups()` (and also wrapper function `epfind()`) to control whether or not to restrict epitope groups to a maximum of one occurrence of a given peptide. Default value TRUE.  
- `epfind()` now write a log file to capture session info and input parameters.   

## Minor changes  
- More uniformly included `close(pb)` to conclude instances of `pb <- utils::txtProgressBar(...)` or `pb <- epitopefindr::epPB(...)`.

# epitopefindr 1.1.26
## Breaking changes
- output table changes (fixed bug with epitope_summary$id number of rows mismatch, outputTable() function now returns a list with epitope_key and epitope_summary tables as elements, epfind() writes csvs with "NA" to fill empty cells)  

## Minor changes
- added parameter `remove.intermediates = FALSE` to epfind(). If set to true, then the /intermediate_files/ folder is deleted from epitopefindr's output directory at the end of the run.

# epitopefindr 1.1.25
## Minor changes
- Added support for command line utility pdfunite as an alternative to pdftk.
- Removed some defunct code and comments.
- Beginnings of framework for parallelization.
